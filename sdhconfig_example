/* BACKUPS CONFIG
*   This feature is only recommended for developers.
*
*   If this feature (GLOBAL.BACKUP_ON = true;) is activated, SDH API will save in /backups path the last
*   information received from SDH-Platform and will save it into different folders for each entity.
*   In each folder, a backup file will be saved with a identifier based on the last update timestamp. This timestamp
*   can be found by analyzing the API log during upgrades (eg. "Updating static info (201601141452774597187)")
*
*   When a backup id specified in BACKUP_LOAD_ID variable (eg. GLOBAL.BACKUP_LOAD = 201601141452774597187;) and
*   BACKUP_LOAD_ON is true, the API will get static information from specified backup files. If this option is activated
*   new backups will not be saved, the API will not be updated with new data and will not ensure proper operation
*   of the system. Returned metric values will be estimations based in metric results obtained during the Backup
*   execution. If you want realistic metrics, you must make several requests to this API in order to make it learn
*   about each metric response. Views will always return all resources.
*
*   When a backup id is specified in BACKUP_LOAD_ID variable (eg. GLOBAL.BACKUP_LOAD = 201601141452774597187;) and
*   BACKUP_UPDATE_METRICS_ON is true, the metric values information will be updated and will be stored in the
*   BACKUP_LOAD_ID file. The other backup information (user, products, projects, etc) will be overwritten and the
*   new backup will be saved with a new id. When BACKUP_UPDATE_METRICS_ON is activated BACKUP_LOAD_ON will be ignored.
*

/* LOG CONFIG
*
*   Log levels:
*       "fatal" (60): The service/app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
*       "error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, but the service/app continues servicing other requests. An operator should look at this soon(ish).
*       "warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
*       "info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
*       "debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
*       "trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.
